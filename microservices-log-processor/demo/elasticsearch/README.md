# ElasticSearch demo guide

To set up an example of logs originating from ElasticSearch, follow this [guide](https://github.com/elastic/examples/tree/master/Common%20Data%20Formats/apache_logs) (**CAREFUL**: it has many outdated commands, see the official docs to proper setup).

The guide sets up the ELK stack for ingesting the apache logs in **apache_logs**. The use here is to have the logs indexed in ElasticSearch queried in the Log Processor.
